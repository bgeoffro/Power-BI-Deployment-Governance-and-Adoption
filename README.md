# Power BI Deployment, Governance, and Adoption

Contoso Healthcare, Inc., has been a healthcare provider for over 20 years. They originally started as a large hospital but now operate several Urgent Care facilities in addition to a dozen physician offices. The healthcare industry is constantly undergoing industry and regulation changes. Most of the software used is proprietary and forces disparate data repositories. 
Three of the concerns Contoso Healthcare is trying solve are controlling costs, maintaining patient quality of care, and meeting regulation requirements. Because of the size of the healthcare system it is difficult to ensure that healthcare providers that are part of the Contoso Healthcare system monitor hospital and healthcare quality indicators.

**Potential ideas**
- Compliance guidelines
- Security
- Processes
- Insight
- KPIs
- Trends
- Inventory

[Note from Brett on ideas: Thinking we should draw from the 9 topics in the adoption roadmap guidance at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/guidance/powerbi-adoption-roadmap-overview to define key requirements and characteristics of Contoso. Since our focus is to ensure our sales teams "sell it right", if we need to prioritize certain topics - or have meatier content in specific ones - we should do that for topics that need to be addressed earlier in the planning cycle and/or that have higher impact if early plans are initially incorrect. Thinking that Matthew will have a good gauge on prioritization.]


Contoso Healthcare needs the ability to collect and analyze data from within their systems in order to make the best uniform solution possible.
They want to provide better visibility to patient data, physician and nurse performance, medical population and stations. 

The improved ability to meet customer demand will be accomplished by establishing a 360-degree view of the supply chain. With data analysis and reporting, stores will be able to plan and schedule product deliveries based on customer sentiment and current buying trends.

## Target audience
- Power BI Specialists
- Power BI Global Black Belts
- Azure Specialists
- App Specialists
- Data and AI Specialists

[Context Notes from Brett: Target audience in Microsoft parlance is: Modern Work Intelligence TSs, Data & AI CSAs, and Modern Work CSMs. In broader functional parlance, it is Power BI technical presales and technical post-sales/customer success roles. The first and primary role is focused on presales (driving revenue); is the only role solely focused on Power BI and is therefore key for deep technical topics, and is on point to address initial deployment & adoption planning and ensure a good handoff to the other roles. D&AI CSAs are on point for driving usage (post-sales) when Azure is connected; MW CSMs are on point for driving usage (post-sales) when PBI is being used in Teams; both are more generalist roles that are not solely focused on PBI and will be less focused on deep technical topics. Partners - who will be a later target audience for this content- potentially perform all of these roles, so it's important to have case study requiremetns that can drive both  high-level planning and technical implementation design discussions.]

## Abstracts

### Workshop

In this workshop, you will architect a deployment of Power BI for Contoso Healthcare using the Power BI Adoption Framework and Power BI enterprise deployment whitepaper. Throughout the whiteboard design session, you will look at the planning process for Power BI, and how to integrate multiple disparate data sources to identify trends that can be presented to executives and also health care professionals throughout the organization.

At the end of this workshop you will be able to better design and discuss the use of the Power BI Adoption Framework, Power BI Usage Scenarios, and Power BI Architectural Choices. 

The primary goal for this system is to not just enable Power BI in the organization but facilitate a release strategy to the organization to improve adoption, governance, and security. 

### Whiteboard design session

In this whiteboard design session, you will use the [Power BI Adoption Framework ](https://github.com/pbiaf/powerbiadoption) and [Power BI enterprise deployment whitepaper](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/guidance/whitepaper-powerbi-enterprise-deployment).  

[Note from Brett: While those resources were in the original spec for this workshop, they are now a subset of the new Power BI Adoption Roadmap (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/guidance/powerbi-adoption-roadmap-overview), though it is important that our technical audience get into some of the specific implementation details as well. Recommend phrasing the intro as follows:
In this whiteboard design session, you will use the [Power BI Adoption Roadmap ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/guidance/powerbi-adoption-roadmap-overview) for broad planning purposes and the [Power BI enterprise deployment whitepaper](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/guidance/whitepaper-powerbi-enterprise-deployment) for planning  technical implementation details.]

You will recommend guidance for deployment based on the following:
- Adoption
- Governance
- Service Management
- Security
- Rollout and Support
- Power BI Usage Scenarios
- Power BI Architectural Choices
